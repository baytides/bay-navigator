## Common Questions

**Q: I served in the National Guard but was never deployed. Am I a veteran?**

A: Under federal law, you may not meet the technical definition of "veteran" unless you served 20+ years or were activated under federal orders. However, many civilian discount programs honor all military service regardless of deployment status.

**Q: My discharge was Other Than Honorable. Can I still get discounts?**

A: It depends on the program. Many civilian discounts don't verify discharge status. For VA benefits, you may still qualify for some programs—contact the VA to review your eligibility.

**Q: How do I prove my spouse is a veteran?**

A: For spousal discounts, you typically need your spouse's military documentation (DD-214 or VA card) plus proof of marriage. Some programs accept your military dependent ID card.

**Q: I'm a Reservist. Do I qualify?**

A: For civilian discounts, most programs include Reservists regardless of activation status. For VA benefits, eligibility depends on your specific service history.
