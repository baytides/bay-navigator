## Age Thresholds Vary by Program

There's no universal age for "senior" status. Different programs set different thresholds:

| Age | Common Programs |
|-----|-----------------|
| **50+** | AARP membership, some gyms, early retirement communities |
| **55+** | Some retail discounts, senior living communities, some transit programs |
| **60+** | Older Americans Act services, some museum discounts, Meals on Wheels |
| **62+** | Social Security early retirement, HUD senior housing, National Park Senior Pass |
| **65+** | Medicare eligibility, most retail senior discounts, property tax exemptions |
| **70+** | Some enhanced discounts, required minimum distributions from retirement accounts |

**Tip:** Always ask about senior discounts—eligibility ages vary widely and aren't always posted.

## How to Verify Your Age

### Government-Issued ID

Most programs accept standard identification:

- California Driver's License or ID Card
- U.S. Passport
- Military ID

### Medicare Card

Your Medicare card confirms you're 65+ (or have qualifying disability). Many programs accept this as proof of senior status.

### AARP Card

While AARP membership starts at 50, an AARP card is widely recognized for senior discounts, though merchants may still require government ID.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: I'm 62. Do I qualify for senior discounts?**

A: It depends on the specific program. Some start at 55, most at 62-65. Always ask, as many businesses don't advertise age thresholds.

**Q: Can I get Medicare before 65?**

A: Yes, if you have a qualifying disability and have received Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) for 24 months, or if you have End-Stage Renal Disease or ALS.

**Q: What's the difference between Medicare and Medi-Cal?**

A: Medicare is federal health insurance primarily for those 65+. Medi-Cal is California's Medicaid program for low-income residents of any age. You can have both ("dual eligible"), which helps cover costs Medicare doesn't.

**Q: How do I find affordable senior housing?**

A: Contact your local Area Agency on Aging, search [HUD's affordable housing database](https://resources.hud.gov/), or check with your county housing authority. Many affordable housing complexes have waitlists, so apply early.
