## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I work and still receive SSDI or SSI?**

A: Yes, both programs have work incentives. SSDI has a Trial Work Period and Ticket to Work program. SSI has earned income exclusions. Contact Social Security or a benefits counselor before starting work to understand how earnings affect your benefits.

**Q: I was denied disability benefits. What can I do?**

A: You can appeal within 60 days of receiving your denial. Many claims are approved on appeal. Consider getting help from a disability rights organization or attorney (most work on contingency for disability cases).

**Q: How long does it take to get approved for SSDI or SSI?**

A: Initial decisions typically take 3-6 months. If you need to appeal, it can take 1-2 years or longer. SSI may provide interim benefits while your case is pending if you appear likely to qualify.

**Q: What's the difference between a handicap placard and a disability rating?**

A: A disabled parking placard (from DMV) is specifically for mobility impairments affecting parking. A disability rating (from Social Security or VA) is a determination of overall disability for benefits purposes. You can have one without the other.
