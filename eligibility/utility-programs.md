## How to Apply for Multiple Programs

### Step 1: Check Your Eligibility

Use **[BenefitsCal.com](https://benefitscal.com)** to screen for public assistance programs (Medi-Cal, CalFresh, CalWORKs). Enrollment in these programs automatically qualifies you for most utility discounts.

### Step 2: Apply for CARE

Once you're enrolled in a qualifying program (or if you meet income limits), apply for CARE through PG&E. This is your gateway to most energy discounts.

### Step 3: Apply for Other Utility Discounts

With CARE approval, you'll often automatically qualify for:
- Water utility discounts (show your CARE confirmation)
- Phone Lifeline (register separately)
- Internet programs (apply through provider)

### Step 4: Request One-Time Assistance if Needed

If you're behind on bills or facing disconnection, contact:
- Your utility's hardship program
- Your county's LIHEAP administrator
- 211 (dial 2-1-1) for local resources

## Avoiding Disconnection

If you're struggling to pay utility bills:

**1. Contact your utility immediately.** Most have payment plans and hardship programs.

**2. Request CARE enrollment.** Retroactive credits may apply.

**3. Apply for LIHEAP.** One-time payments can cover past-due amounts.

**4. Medical Baseline.** If you have medical equipment, ask about protections against shutoff.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I get CARE if I rent and utilities are included?**

A: If you pay your utility bill directly (even if you're a renter), you can apply. If utilities are included in rent and your landlord pays, you may not be able to get CARE directly, but your building may qualify for a master-metered discount.

**Q: How long does CARE approval take?**

A: Typically 2-4 weeks. If approved, discounts may be applied retroactively.

**Q: Do I need to reapply for CARE every year?**

A: CARE requires recertification every 2 years. PG&E will send a notice when it's time.

**Q: Can I get CARE and LIHEAP?**

A: Yes! CARE is an ongoing discount; LIHEAP is one-time assistance. You can use both.

**Q: I have solar panels. Can I still get CARE?**

A: Yes, CARE applies to the electricity you purchase from the grid. You'll still receive the discount on net usage.
