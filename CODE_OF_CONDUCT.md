# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

Bay Navigator is a community resource project dedicated to helping Bay Area residents find free and low-cost programs. We are committed to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

**Positive behavior includes:**

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

**Unacceptable behavior includes:**

- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (issues, pull requests, discussions) and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening a [GitHub issue](../../issues/new) or contacting the maintainers directly. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1.
