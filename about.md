## Why We Built This

Cost often determines choices. When sustainable options are more expensive, people pick what they can afford. The programs listed here help close that gap.

---

## The Environmental Case

Many of these programs have environmental benefits:

- **Transit discounts** reduce car trips and emissions
- **Libraries and tool-lending** mean less stuff manufactured and thrown away
- **Food assistance** helps reduce food waste by matching supply to need
- **Utility programs** (CARE, FERA, ESA) lower energy use through efficiency upgrades
- **Free park access** gets more people outdoors

## Who This Is For

<div class="simple-language-summary" aria-label="Simple language summary">
This is for anyone who lives in the Bay Area and wants to save money. It doesn't matter how much money you make - there are programs for everyone.
</div>

Anyone in the nine-county Bay Area: low-income households, seniors, veterans, students, people with disabilities, families, or anyone looking to save money.

We added [Eligibility Guides](/eligibility/) because knowing about a discount isn't useful if you don't know whether you qualify or how to apply. These guides cover programs like Medi-Cal, CalFresh, veteran benefits, student discounts, and utility assistance.

We're not benefits counselors—just pointing people in the right direction. We focus on the Bay Area because local details matter.
