  "howToGetIt": "General Application Process The steps you must take to apply for a Green Card will vary depending on your individual situation. However, here is the general application process that most applicants will go through - Someone usually must file an immigrant petition for you (often referred to as sponsoring or petitioning for you). In some cases, you may be eligible to file for yourself - After USCIS approves the immigrant petition, and there is a visa available in your category, you file either a Green Card application with USCIS or a visa application with the U.S. Department of State - You go to a biometrics appointment to provide fingerprints, photos, and a signature - You go to an interview - You receive a decision on your application. If You Already Have a Green Card If you already have a Green Card, go to our After a Green Card is Granted page for more information on travel, renewing a card, and your rights and responsibilities as a Green Card holder.",
