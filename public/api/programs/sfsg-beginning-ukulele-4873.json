  "description": "Have fun learning to play the ukulele. We will start by learning how to press, pick and strum. As the session progresses, we will move on to easy chords, scales, and rhythms that we can use to play some of our favorite songs in different musical styles. Ukuleles can be borrowed for the class during class time, but it is recommended that students bring their own so they may practice at home between classes.",
