  "description": "The goal of our Nagaiki Caregiver Referral Program is to enable seniors to live an independent life at home, for as long as possible, with “Kimochi” care and support. To that end, we offer a Nagaiki List of caregivers along with resources to help seniors and their families in the search and hiring process. Kimochi is not a home care agency. We do not bond or insure the caregivers who are listed in our current registry. The senior and/or family is the employers and will make decisions on schedule",
