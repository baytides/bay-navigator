  "howToGetIt": "Patients must be traveling to a cancer-related medical appointment. Other eligibility requirements may apply. For example, a caregiver may need to accompany a patient who cannot walk without help, or is under age 18. Contact us to find out what is available in your area, and what the specific requirements are. It can take several business days to coordinate your ride, so please call us at 1-800-227-2345 well in advance of your appointment date.",
