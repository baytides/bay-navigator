  "description": "Founded in 1937 on land owned by the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission (located only 3 km away from Jerusalem in the town where the resurrection of Lazarus miracle took place), the school provides a fine general education for 350 girls, ages 4-16, as well as Russian and English languages and the Law of God. The school, whose operating budget is derived from tourism, has been struggling due to pandemic. Our main concern is the welfare of the eight orphans, who are totally dependent on donors.",
