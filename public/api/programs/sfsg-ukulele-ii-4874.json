  "description": "Ukulele II is for students who have some previous experience playing the ukulele or who have taken the Beginning Ukulele class. We will continue our study of scales, chords and rhythms to learn more challenging songs. Each student will have the option to share an in class performance of a song that they have practiced. Ukuleles can be borrowed for the class during class time, but it is recommended that students bring their own so they may practice at home between classes.",
